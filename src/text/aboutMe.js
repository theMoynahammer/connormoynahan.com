            content: `After Virginia Tech I joined Capital One as a part of their Technology Development Program; which placed you in a role for one year, and then rotated 
            into a new postion. I started out as a process manager, and while it was a good initial position out of college (and it helped in strengthening my detail-oriented skillset).
            My second position was as a Tester. I was a member of an agile team and ensured quality of software prior to release. From there, I became an integration test lead, 
            which comprised of consolidating testing reports of a number of agile teams prior to release. My biggest takeaway from this position was being customer oriented with software. Being exclusively a tester was not my passion, 
            and I worked with my director at the time to transition into becoming a software engineer. I consider myself fortunate to have been able to learn on the job, while being able to slowly ramp up and deliver 
            software. This was my calling. I love making software. I enjoy creating applications/experiences for users (both technical/non-technical) that achieve a purpose, and achieve that purpose 
            in an efficient way. My favorite part of this industry is that the learning is neverending. The tech landscape is evolving and changing rapidly, and I enjoy learning about a topic and strengthening my knowledge base.`

            content: `I enjoy playing strategy board games; sitting down and setting a plan (win or lose) is always fun to me. I also enjoy being active, be it: yard work, frisbee golf, golf, walking, weight lifting, running or basketball.
             I am a fan of video games as well, and play both my Switch and my Xbox. I played tennis and basketball for my High School and played rugby for Virginia Tech for 3 years. I was too banged up 
             to continue my rugby career after college, but I continue to play tennis and basketball.
             I was also a tennis coach for 4 years at the end of HS through college.  I've always had a love/hate relationship with running,
             but I conquered that in 2019 when I completed the Richmond Half-Marathon for the first time, after previously running in the Monument 10k for the past
             ~7 years. I enjoy following the NBA and Washington sports teams. I also enjoy golfing, I don't play enough to see steady improvement, but it's a great way to spend a Saturday morning.`
